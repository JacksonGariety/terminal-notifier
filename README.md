# terminal-notifier

This is a fork of @alloy's terminal-notifier for my project, kvetch.

https://rubygems.org/gems/kvetch`

terminal-notifier is a middleman app to send Mac OS X User Notifications, which are available in Mac OS X 10.8 and higher.

@alloy's original Ruby command-line interface has been removed in this fork, and farmed out to https://github.com/JacksonGariety/kvetch.

## Usage

```
$ ./kvetch.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier -[message|group|list] [VALUE|ID|ID] [options]
```

In order to use this fork of terminal-notifier, use the kvetch gem like so:

    $ gem install kvetch

Then in your Ruby project:

    require 'Kvetch'

    Kvetch.yell('a problem you finna resolve')
